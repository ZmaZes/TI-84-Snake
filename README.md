# TI-84-Snake
A non jailbreak program to play snake on the TI-84+ CSE and TI-84+ CE coded by hand in TI-Basic on my calculator during spare time at school.

# Downloads & Compatibility
This program supports both the TI-84 Plus CE (CE) and the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition (CSE).
You may find that version 1.0 may work better on the CSE, or that the latest version performs better when overclocked.

üîó[Latest Version (v5.3)](https://github.com/ZmaZes/TI-84-Snake/releases/tag/v5.3) 

üîó[Old Version (v1.0)](https://github.com/ZmaZes/TI-84-Snake/releases/tag/v1.0)

# Options
|Setting|Description|
|--|--|
|Screen Wrap|If enabled, the edge of the screen will warp you to the opposite side instead of killing you.|
|Speed|Either 1x or 0.5x; If 0.5x the game will run at half speed.|
|Tail Collision|If enabled, the head has collision with its tail. This is disabled by default on the CSE to improve performance.|
|Apple Flicker|If enabled, the apple will flicker like it does in v1.0.|
|Quick Start|If enabled, the game starts at the max speed.|
|Initial Tail|The length (1-100) of the snake's tail at the beginning of the game.|
|Stage Width|The width [half] of the game's boundaries. A width of 12 represents 24 horizontal squares of movement.|
|Tail Pattern|If enabled, every 10th piece of tail will have an orange box around it.|
|Turn Indicators|If enabled, pieces of the tail where the player turned will form a cross instead of a dot.|
|Head Color|Controls the color of the snake's head. Not available on the CSE due to a bug in the OS.|
|Tail Color|Controls the color of the snake's tail. The border of the graphing window will also change to the closest color to this color, and the text on the main menu will also match this color.|
