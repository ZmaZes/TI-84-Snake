# TI-84-Snake
A non jailbreak program to play snake on the TI-84+ CSE and TI-84+ CE coded by hand in TI-Basic on my calculator during spare time at school.

# Downloads & Compatibility
This program supports both the TI-84 Plus CE (CE) and the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition (CSE).

You may find that version 1.0 works better on the CSE due to that version being more lightweight.

üîó[Latest Version (v6.0)](https://github.com/ZmaZes/TI-84-Snake/releases/tag/v6.0)

üîó[Old Version (v1.0)](https://github.com/ZmaZes/TI-84-Snake/releases/tag/v1.0)

Use the [TI Connect CE App](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware#:~:text=TI%20Connect%E2%84%A2%20CE%20Software%20for%20Windows%C2%AE%20(EXE)) to transfer programs to your calculator.
